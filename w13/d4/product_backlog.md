* Generally accepted approach to tackling product backlog is user stories. 'As a... I want/need/expect... so that...'.
* Try to output focussed: 'I want to see...', not 'I want an API'.

    - potentially shippable (works)
    - subject to acceptable functionality and presentation (polish)
    - so, what are the acceptance criteria for done? think about this to clarify user stories.
